* The misnomer 'Downsample' has been changed to Decimation.
  When upgrading an existing model, re-enter the required decimation
  rate in 
  Configuration Parameters -> Real-Time Workshop -> EtherLab C code generation ->
  Process Image decimation rate

  The decimation rate defines how many model calculation steps are skipped
  by the buddy when transferring BlockIO data to the Model Visualisation.
